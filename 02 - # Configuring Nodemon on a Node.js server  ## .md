# Configuring Nodemon on a Node.js server

## The constant rebooting of a Node.js application manually is a very tedious and tiring job, but to avoid having to do this work over and over again, Nodemon is responsible for automatically restarting the Node.js application server in development mode.

In the following steps, I will show you how to install and configure Nodemon in your project and how to run a Node.js. server.

## Step 1

Organize the `src` source directory and start the server in a `server.js `file, the file can carry any convention that is used to start a Node.js server ( `index.js` or `app.js`)

Update the `package.json` by adding a start script

```json
{
  "name": "nodemon",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/server.js"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "Francisco Suarez <imanolsuarez98@gmail.com>",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

## Step 2

Add `Express` this will allow us to start a minimum server to perform this test

```javascript
'use strict';

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use('/', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send('La API funciona correctamente');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Start a new terminal in which we will start the server executing the script `npm start`after executing it, it will return a message like the following `node src/index.js`

Open a new terminal and execute the following code `curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/` that will allow us to verify that the API works correctly.

```javascript
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/
La API funciona correctamente!
```

If we return the message `La API funciona correctamente! `it means that we are doing well!

Now, if we change the response message in the `server.js` file, you will have to restart the server manually to get the desired result:

```javascript
app.use('/', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send('Lorem Ipsum');
});
```

Use `CTRL + C` to stop the server that is currently running and restart it using the same command before: `npm run start.`

Using the curl command again from the terminal window we obtain the desired result:

```javascript
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/
Lorem Ipsum
```

Step 3
Add Nodemon as `devDependency` :

```javascript
$ npm i -D nodemon
```

We will review the `package.json`

```javascript
  "name": "nodemon",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/server.js"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "Francisco Suarez <imanolsuarez98@gmail.com>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "4.15.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "1.11.0"
  }

```

## Stage 4

Add the dev command to the `package.json` file

```javascript
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon --watch src src/server.js"
  }
}
```

Now run `npm run dev` and request again the use of the curl command, and we will see that the message is the same as we had before:

```javascript
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/
Lorem Ipsum
```

If I change the message in the file `server.js `again, and this time I will not have to restart the server, since Nodemon is observing the changes using the `src` directory, through its parameter `‚Äî watch` .

You will see that it is updated only without having to restart the server, to cut it press `CTRL + C`
